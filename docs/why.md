## Why we built this?

We created the "Euro Star" because we think the European Union is a great idea.
Tingg.io is a very international team that loves and encourages diversity.

The Berlin Maker Faire takes place one week before the European election 2019 and in the middle of the painful Brexit.
Our "Euro Star" is a reminder that democracy is built on people and their right to vote.
So, even if you don't agree with our idea for Europe we encourage you to vote â€“ because we think your opinion matters.

The ode to joy is considered the European hymn.
It is arguably the most famous tune there is and it uses just five notes.
It is a great example of how powerful simplicity can be.
We owe Ludwig van Beethoven big time because this piece of music is a manifesto of everything
that makes people and live awesome: solidarity, joyfulness and the certainty that we can create a better future.

Thank you Ludwig.
