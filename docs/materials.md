## List of materials
  - 2x esp32 microcontroller
  - 2x micro usb cable 
  - 3x small breadboards
  - thin aluminium sheet 1mm or less, alternatively soda cans can work too
  - wooden board 70x40 (w x h) - not too thick
  - 4x Wooden legs - not too tall
  - blue and yellow spray can
  - normal adhesive tape
  - double-sided adhesive tape (thin one)
  - wires

esp32s are the brain of the piano. We are using esp32s because they have touch pins which will be connected with wires to aluminum stars on the board. esp32s will detect touches and send data to the tingg.io platform. 
The wooden board is used to hold everything in place and to look like a flag.
The stars will be cut out of the aluminum sheet, it's important the sheet is thin so that it's easy to cut it with scissors.
Stars are connected with esp32s via wires.
